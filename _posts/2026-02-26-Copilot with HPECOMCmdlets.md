Hands-On Lab Guide

Experience the power of AI and get code written for you by GitHub
Copilot, providing just plain English prompts, using a PowerShell
library for Compute Ops Management.

# Introduction

Welcome to this Hands-On Lab (HOL). For the next two hours you will
complete a self-paced lab using HPE ProLiant DL-series servers, HPE
GreenLake Compute Ops Management, and GitHub Copilot AI.

## Lab Objectives

Get GitHub Copilot to write PowerShell code for you, even if you don't
know much about PowerShell, using a library that wraps the APIs provided
by the GreenLake Platform and Compute Ops Management (COM). This can
help you add automation to server management at scale. Automation is
crucial for server management in datacenters because it reduces manual
effort, minimizes errors, and ensures consistent, reliable operations.
Automated processes speed up routine tasks like provisioning,
monitoring, and updating servers, which improves efficiency and
scalability while lowering operational costs. This allows IT teams to
focus on strategic work and helps maintain high availability and
security across the infrastructure.

## Team Assignments

This lab has 25 stations. Each station will have its own HPE DL-series
server to be onboarded into COM. You will be working in a Virtual
Machine using Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot integration.

Your team assignments will be on a separate sheet of paper issued to you
by your lab proctor. Please return the team assignment sheet to your
proctor when finished with this lab.

## Virtual Lab Environment

Upon access to the lab, you will be presented with a Windows desktop.

Each team will have the following physical and virtual infrastructure:

- Windows virtual machine with Visual Studio Code

- One ProLiant DL-series server

# HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell Library

This library offers a robust set of cmdlets (PowerShell functions)
designed to manage and automate your HPE GreenLake environment
efficiently. By leveraging this library, users can seamlessly interact
with HPE GreenLake and Compute Ops Management services directly from the
PowerShell command line, integrating effortlessly into existing
automation workflows.

This module is available in the PowerShell Gallery under the name
[HPECOMCmdlets](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/HPECOMCmdlets),
following the naming convention used by most HPE modules.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image3.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image3.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

The PowerShell Gallery is a repository for sharing and distributing
PowerShell modules and scripts. It's a community-driven platform that
provides access to various PowerShell resources, enabling you to easily
discover, install, and publish your own PowerShell content. The
PowerShell Gallery can be accessed through the PowerShellGet module
(includes **Install-Module**, **Find-Module**, etc.), which comes
pre-installed with Windows PowerShell 5.0 and above.

This project is also associated with a public GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library)
from our community contributor, Lionel Jullien from HPE. This repository
is where the source code is developed. You can also track
[releases](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/releases),
report and view
[issues](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/issues),
and participate in
[discussions](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/discussions).

This library provides a variety of key features for managing HPE
GreenLake and Compute Ops Management. Here are the main features:

- **Authentication**: Connect to HPE GreenLake using single-factor or
  multifactor authentication with or without an existing workspace.

- **Workspace Management**: Create and manage HPE GreenLake workspaces.

- **Session Tracking**: Automatically track sessions with the global
  session tracker \$HPEGreenLakeSession.

- **User Management**: Invite and manage users within your HPE GreenLake
  environment, assign roles.

- **Resource Management**: Manage resources such as servers, storage,
  and networking within your HPE GreenLake environment.

- **Service Provisioning**: Provision services like Compute Ops
  Management, manage service roles and subscriptions.

- **Device Management**: Add devices individually or in bulk using CSV
  files, manage device subscriptions and auto-subscriptions, set device
  locations and connect devices to services.

- **Server configuration Management**: Create and apply BIOS, storage,
  OS, and firmware settings. Manager group and apply configurations to
  groups of servers.

- **Security and Compliance**: Manage iLO security settings and run
  inventory and compliance checks.

- **Job Scheduling and Execution**: Schedule and execute various tasks
  like firmware updates, OS installations, and sustainability reports.

- **Notification and Integration**: Enable email notifications for
  service events and summaries, integrate with external services like
  ServiceNow.

- **Appliance Management**: Add HPE OneView and Secure Gateway
  appliances, upgrade HPE OneView appliances.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Monitor alerts for your resources to ensure
  optimal performance and uptime.

- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on resource usage,
  performance, and other metrics.

- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks and workflows using
  PowerShell scripts and cmdlets.

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other tools and platforms
  using REST APIs and webhooks.

- **Security**: Implement security best practices and manage access
  control for your HPE GreenLake environment.

These features collectively provide a comprehensive set of cmdlets to
manage various aspects of your HPE GreenLake environment and any
existing Compute Ops Management service instances.

# Getting familiar with Visual Studio Code

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a free, open-source code editor
developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for writing, editing, and
debugging code in many programming languages. VS Code offers features
like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, integrated
terminal, version control, and a rich ecosystem of extensions. It is
available for all major operating systems, Windows, MacOS and Linux.

To start VS Code, click its icon in the taskbar

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image5.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image5.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

This is what the window should look like:

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image6.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image6.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Most of your work will be to type or paste text in the Copilot prompt
field at the bottom right

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image7.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image7.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

But first, let's make sure VS Code is properly configured for Copilot.
Click the user icon at the bottom of the Activity bar

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image8.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image8.png){:class="img-100"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

A menu should open with at the top bot-compute-labnn_hpeprod (GitHub)
where nn is your team number. This is the user with which you are logged
into GitHub, ensuring your rights to Copilot.

You should also look at the bottom right, just below the area where you
will enter Copilot prompts

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image9.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image9.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

It shows the mode you will be using (Agent) and the LLM (Large Language
Model) set to Claude Sonnet 4.5. An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a
type of artificial intelligence that uses deep learning to understand
and generate human-like text. LLMs are trained on massive amounts of
data and can perform tasks such as answering questions, summarizing
information, translating languages, and generating content. In this lab,
we will be using the LLM to write PowerShell code. While you are free to
change the LLM, in our experience Claude Sonnet offers the best results
for this particular task.

# Your first prompt

We are now ready to start coding.

> ⚠️ **Important note**   
>
>{: .small-space}
> 
> ```text
> In the rest of this document text like this represents a prompt that 
 you should type or copy and paste into the Copilot prompt area.
> ```

In AI, a prompt is the input or instruction you give to an artificial
intelligence model---such as a question, command, or statement---to
guide it in generating a specific response. The prompt provides the AI
with context or directions, helping it produce output that matches your
intent, whether that's text, code, images, or other results. The quality
and clarity of your prompt directly affect how useful and relevant the
AI's response will be. If you feel adventurous, you can change the
prompts slightly, but this lab has been tested with the prompts
provided. Results will be different with other prompts, and could also
be different even with the exact same prompts, that is the nature of AI.

Here is our first prompt:

```text
I want to write PowerShell code that connects to HPE Greenlake and COM
using the HPECOMcmdlets library. The code should take a username (email)
as a parameter and prompt for a password
```

After a few seconds, you should see your Copilot's response in plain
English, explaining what it did. But the code itself is in a file that
Copilot created. Click on the tab it created in the main editing window,
as depicted below:

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image10.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image10.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

The ![](/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image11.png) icon next to the file name means the file
has pending changes from Copilot.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image12.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image12.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

The generated code is on green background. Click on Keep (either at the
top or at the bottom) to accept the changes. Later when Copilot wants to
make multiple changes in one strike, the Keep/Undo at the top relates to
the particular change where it is displayed, and the one at the bottom
relates to all the changes (that's why here it says 1 of 1 at the
bottom, later you will see 1 of n). So, you will click Keep at the
bottom to accept all changes.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image13.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image13.png){:class="img-100"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

The green background will go away, as well as the icon next to the file
name in the tab header. If you are ever unhappy with the changes
proposed by Copilot, you can click Undo instead of Keep, to ignore the
latest suggested change and write another prompt.

You can see that with this simple first prompt, Copilot wrote fairly
comprehensive code with comments (text in green), error handling
(try/catch blocks), parameter binding, etc. If this looks like gibberish
to you, that's OK, your Copilot assistant is here to handle the
technical details!

# Copilot can make mistakes

While Copilot is a great help, it is not perfect right from the start.
You still need to be in control and check your assistant's work. In this
particular case, the names of the cmdlets that Copilot generated are not
correct, they do not match what the HPECOMcmdlets library provides. This
is because the LLM does not know this library (yet), so it
"hallucinates" some of its responses. This is very common in AI, a
hallucination occurs when an AI model generates information that is
inaccurate, misleading, or entirely fabricated, even though it may sound
plausible. These outputs are not based on real data or facts but are the
result of the model making incorrect predictions or \"guesses\". But do
not fear, we can easily fix that by providing Copilot with some context.
This is the equivalent of sending our junior coder to training, except
it's vastly faster than with human beings.

```text
Your cmdlets are not correct. Use the HPECOMcmdlets source code and
examples at <https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library>
```

Whenever you instruct Copilot to fetch information from the Internet, it
may ask you for permission to do so with something like this in the
prompt area. Click the down arrow next to Allow and click the response
highlighted in red to give Copilot the widest permission so it hopefully
does not ask you again.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image14.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image14.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

This will take slightly longer as Copilot fetches information from the
repository. You should see it changes the cmdlet to connect to Greenlake
to the proper one Connect-HPEGL. Click Keep to accept the changes.

Get used to watching the bottom right of the prompt area, this will give
you a clue whether Copilot is still thinking or if it's ready to accept
the next prompt. When it's thinking it will show this icon:

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image15.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image15.png){:class="img-300"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

When it's ready for your next prompt, it will show this icon instead,
that you can click to submit your prompt (pressing Enter has the same
effect)

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image16.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image16.png){:class="img-300"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Copilot has added a Workspace parameter (which is indeed common when
using this library) but we don't want that because we are going to
create our own workspace.

```text
Remove the workspace parameter, I want to connect without a workspace
and create one later
```

Code removed in on [red background]{.mark}, code added is on [green
background]{.mark}. As always, click Keep to accept the changes.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image17.jpg){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image17.jpg){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}


# Create a workspace

In HPE GreenLake, a workspace is an environment where users can organize
and manage resources, such as servers, storage, and services, for
specific projects or teams. Workspaces help separate and control access
to different sets of resources, making it easier to manage permissions,
monitor usage, and automate tasks within a defined scope.

In the following prompt, replace nn with your team number, for example
09, before sending the prompt to Copilot

```text
Create a workspace with name GHCPWorkspaceTnn_random where random is a random number. Use the following parameters:
Type: Standard enterprise workspace
Email: the email address used to connect
Street: make up an address
City: make up a city
Country: Austria
```

Copilot might want to make another script for the create workspace
script. We want everything in the same script that we will execute at
the end. If it did create another script, tell it not to:

```text
Do not create a second script, integrate everything into the existing script
```

Make sure you close the tab for the second script
Create-HPEWorkspace.ps1 to avoid confusion, and delete the file
(right-click it in the left-hand sidebar and click Delete). Copilot
might also offer to delete the file itself, but it will ask for
permission before doing so. If you see a question "Run pwsh command?"
with a command like Remove-Item followed by the path to the second
script file, click Allow and Copilot will delete the file.

It may also want to make the workspace creation optional with a script
parameter. We want to create a workspace on every run. If you see lines
like this in the changes near the top of the file:

> \[Parameter(Mandatory = \$false)\]\
> \[switch\]\$CreateWorkspace

Tell it we do not want the workspace creation to be optional

```text
Do not make the workspace creation optional
```

We also want to reconnect to Greenlake after creating the workspace,
this is specific to how the HPECOMcmdlets library works (and it displays
a message saying this is necessary when you create a workspace)

```text
Reconnect to Greenlake after the workspace creation if successful
```

## Invite another user to the workspace

We want to invite another user to our workspace. In this lab context, it
also ensures that we can reset the lab and perform the necessary actions
once your lab is complete, so please do not miss this step

```text
Add user admin@hpelabs.ddnsfree.com to the workspace
```

## Provision Compute Ops Management in the workspace

We need to make Compute Ops Management available in our workspace, this
is called provisioning a service in Greenlake. All services can be
provisioned in multiple regions and we need to specify which region we
want.

```text
Provision service Compute Ops Management in region eu-central
```

We also need to give our 2 users Administrator roles for the COM service

```text
Add Compute Ops Management Administrator role to the 2 users in the workspace
```

## Create a location

Locations are part of the Service Delivery Information (SDI) that is
available to automate support workflows. Locations capture addresses,
contacts, and service delivery information for operations, management,
and commerce. Assigning a device to a location is the process of
attaching a device to a physical location to automate support and
services for this device.

```text
Create a location with name LocationTnn and these parameters
Country, Street, City and PostalCode the same as the workspace
State "none"
Primary Contact Email the user's email
```

## Add a subscription

To activate compute devices that will be added later to your workspace,
you need to install a COM subscription key (a licence to use COM). Be
sure to replace the string \<key found on your login sheet\> before
submitting your prompt to Copilot!

```text
Add subscription key <key found on your login sheet>
```

Set automatic subscription assignment and reassignment for Compute. The
COM subscription tier is STANDARD

# Onboarding devices

We are now ready to add a server to our COM workspace. We will use a
method that would work just as well if we had dozens or even hundreds of
servers to add, even though in this lab you will only add one. We should
prepare a file with the details of the server(s) we want to add. In VS
Code menu click File -\> New File

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image18.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image18.png){:class="img-300"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Type the file name ilos.csv and Enter

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image19.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image19.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

A standard Windows dialog will appear to choose the location where you
want to save the file. It should be in folder HOL09-Tnn \>
GitHubCopilotLab. Click Create File.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image20.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image20.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Decline VS Code's suggestion to install an extension to handle CSV files
(at the bottom right of the screen), we don't really need it for the
simple work we have to do

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image21.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image521.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Copy the following data into the ilos.csv file and replace the
placeholders in \<red\> with your team\'s information from the login
sheet:\
\
IP, Username, Password\
10.18.26.\<xx\>, Administrator, \<iLO's password\>

Make sure the data is on 2 lines like shown above, with no extra space
at the beginning or end of either line (space after a comma is OK).
Copy/paste tends to put everything on a single line. Save the file with
Ctrl-S or File-\>Save in VS Code's menu

If we had more servers to onboard, we would simply add more lines into
this file and our script would iterate over each line.

Go back to your PowerShell script tab in VS Code and tell Copilot to
import the csv file

```text
Import file ilos.csv. Double check the field names in the csv file.
```

You should see it generated code to import the file into a variable
\$iLOs (it even figured out on its own the proper case for the name
iLO!). It may have put the code in the middle of the script, before
creating the workspace, but that's OK.

To add servers into COM, we need an activation key that we can ask COM
to generate. This key encodes all the information (such as the workspace
id) that an iLO will need, to know what it should connect to.

```text
Generate a COM activation key
```

And now we have everything we need to bring our server into COM

```text
Connect all the iLOs from the CSV file to COM. Make sure the activation
key is created before this step
```

You can see how it created a loop
ForEach (\$iLO in \$iLOs)

then created a Credentials object for the username and password imported
from the CSV file and used it with the proper
Connect-HPEGLDeviceComputeiLOtoCOM cmdlet

## Set device location and tags

We want to assign our server to the location we created previously. This
is needed to ensure that support cases are automatically created in the
event of device failures.

Assign the location we created previously to the device

**Tags** in HPE GreenLake are metadata labels---key-value pairs---that
you can attach to cloud resources. Their main purpose is to help you
categorize, organize, and manage resources based on criteria like
purpose, owner, environment, cost center, or other custom attributes.

Add tag "Country=AT, App=AI" to the device

# Configuration of Compute Ops Management

Now that we have a server onboarded, we are going to use some of the
features that COM provides for server management

## Create server settings

Server settings are predefined or custom configuration templates that
define how servers should be configured. They allow administrators to
apply consistent configurations---such as firmware baselines, BIOS
settings, workload profiles, or other system parameters---to one or more
servers at scale.

First create BIOS settings

```text
Create a BIOS setting with name Custom-Bios-For-AI, Workload Profile
"Virtualization -- Max Performance", Automatic Server Recovery on with a
timeout of 10 minutes
```

Next, create settings for internal storage

```text
Create an internal storage setting with name RAID-1, RAID level 1, take
the entire disk
```

Create firmware settings

``` text
Create firmware settings with the latest firmware bundles for Gen10 and
Gen11
```

## Create a server group

A server group containing the settings we just created will allow to
keep configuration consistent across all servers added to that group

```text
Create a server group named AI_Group with the 3 settings we created
previously. Make sure the settings are not applied automatically when a
server is added to the group
```

## Add servers to the group

Now we add our server to the group

```text
Add our server to the group
```

## Collect servers inventory data

```text
Run a job to collect our server inventory data, make sure the job is run
asynchronously
```

## Set iLO auto firmware update

```text
Set our server to automatically update iLO firmware to the newest
available
```

## Update server firmware

The firmware update step is crucial to ensure that servers are up to
date. Administrators typically need to perform this task regularly to
maintain optimal performance and security. In this step, you will create
a scheduled task to run a firmware update during the next weekend for
all servers in your group. Do NOT try to run a firmware update
immediately, keep the schedule to next Sunday.

```text
Schedule a server firmware update through the group for next Sunday at
5am
```

This concludes our code writing exercise. We are now ready to test our
coding skills by running the script we created.

# Execute the script

> ⚠️ **Important note**   
>
>{: .small-space}
> 
> Before running the script, it is very useful to ask Copilot to

> ```

If you didn't get it previously, you are likely at this step to get a
prompt asking you for permission to fetch contents from The GitHub
repository:

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image14.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image14.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Click the down arrow next to Allow and click the response highlighted in
red in the screenshot to give Copilot the widest permission.

You will likely see multiple edits throughout the file. Unlike humans,
an AI agent can be quite good at fixing its own errors if we give it
appropriate data. It should even create a CORRECTIONS_NEEDED.md file
which lists all the corrections it made.

Go back to our PowerShell script tab. To execute our script, go to VS
Code menu Run, and pick Run Without Debugging

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image22.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image22.png){:class="img-300"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Watch the PowerShell terminal at the bottom of the VS Code window. It
should prompt you for a username, type the email address for the
Greenlake account found on your team login sheet.

Next, it should prompt you for the account's password that you can also
find on your team login sheet. Do not confuse the Horizon credentials
you used at the beginning to connect to the lab environment, and the
Greenlake credentials you are using now, they are not the same.

Once you enter the password, the rest of the script will run, displaying
what it is doing. In parallel, you can use the Graphical User Interface
(GUI) of COM to follow the script's actions. In a browser go to
<https://common.cloud.hpe.com/> and logon with the same credentials you
used in the script. You should see a screen showing a list of workspaces
and you should click Launch next to the workspace that was just
created:

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image23.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image23.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

If you do not see a workspace with a name following the template used in
this lab, it would indicate that the workspace creation did not work. In
this case you should inspect the terminal window in VS code and look for
any errors.

Once you are in the lab's workspace, launch the COM service:

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image24.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image24.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image25.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image25.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image26.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image26.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

If you don't see it, either the script didn't reach the step where it
provisions the service yet, or it encountered an error.

When you are in COM, go to Servers and see if your server is there

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image27.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image27.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

Even after the script has finished without errors, it can take several
minutes before the server shows State Connected in COM as in the
screenshot above. You can also go to the iLO: make a new browser tab and
connect to <https://10.18.26.xxx/> taking the proper IP address from
your login sheet. Login with Administrator and the password provided on
your login sheet. Click the HPE Compute Ops Management tile on the
dashboard. Do NOT click the Launch HPE Greenlake button as you already
have a tab connected to Greenlake.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image28.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image28.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

In the page that opens you can see the connection status and potentially
the different steps it goes through before reaching Connected

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image29.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image29.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

In COM, go to Manage then Settings to explore the Groups and Settings
you have created with the script. In particular on the Settings page you
should observe the settings that do not show HPE pre-defined in the Type
column. These are the 3 settings you defined with the script, BIOS,
internal storage and firmware. You may note that firmware and internal
storage are User defined, while BIOS is API defined. This is because it
is currently not possible to create BIOS settings via the GUI. You must
use the API (which is what the script does) to create that type of
settings.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image30.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-Copilot-With-HPECOMCmdlets/image30.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

You should also examine the terminal output in the VS Code window where
the script ran to look for any errors. If there are any, the next step
would be to understand and fix the errors. Try and devise your own
prompts to do so. You may also point Copilot to an error and ask it if
it can fix it. If the error happened after the Workspace creation, you
could ask Copilot to create a continuation script from the point where
it errored out, using the already created Workspace. But you can also
run the entire script again, it will create another Workspace with a
random element in its name. However, if the script ran previously up to
the step where it connects the server to COM and that was successful,
then you must create a continuation script as you will not be able to
run the entire script again and connect your server to a new Workspace
since it is already connected.

Note that at some point, human expertise might be needed. AI is a great
help, but it's not perfect!

# HOL Summary

This Hands-On Lab is now complete. Thank you for taking the time to
participate, hopefully you received a deeper understanding of how you
could use GitHub Copilot to help you automate server management with HPE
GreenLake Compute Ops Management.

Over the course of the lab, users leverage AI‑assisted code generation
and the **HPECOMcmdlets** PowerShell library to build a complete
automation workflow that provisions a workspace, configures services,
and onboards and manages an HPE ProLiant server through COM.
