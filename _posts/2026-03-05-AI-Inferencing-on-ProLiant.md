## Section 2: Text to Image Generation with HPE ProLiant Compute

For generative AI workloads such as product design, 3D animation, and image or video generation, the HPE ProLiant DL380a Gen12 server delivers the rendering and design performance required by demanding visual applications across the media and entertainment, healthcare and manufacturing industries.

Generative AI generates lifelike and dynamic pictures, 3D animations (including character movements,) physics simulations, and environmental effects. You use it to curate new visual content, such as images or videos, that mimic real-world data.

As an example of Generative AI Inferencing, we will install and use SwarmUI in our environment. The steps to install the environment are basically the following:

- We have already installed and setup SwarmUI for this experience.

- Launch and use SwarmUI to generate images from text prompts.

In this lab we will use SwarmUI to experience Generative AI in a live environment.

### Task 1: Some pre-work to prepare our workstation

Before we start using our environment, some preliminary work needs to be done to make our installation process work correctly.

Each of these environments needs additional services and applications installed, to get this to all work together. Both environments also have configuration files that need to be edited to customize the environment, so things work correctly.

We are going to do that pre-work first as it will allow the labs to flow more smoothly.

### Task 2: Using SwarmUI for text-to-image generation (with GPU)

We have preinstalled and setup SwarmUI for this experience.

What we want to demonstrate in this hands-on experience, is the difference in performance you experience when you use a Generative AI application like SwarmUI.

Your environment has been set up in such a way that your VM has been configured with a portion of the NVIDIA GPU installed in the ESXi host where your VM is running. You don’t have the entire GPU dedicated to your instance; you are sharing it with other students.

1. Click the Generate tab at the top of the page. Then navigate to the Models tab in the middle of the page and click the Refresh button.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img34.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img34.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

2. The flux-mini model we downloaded for you should be visible. Double-click the model card to load the model.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img35.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img35.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

3. Under Core Parameters we need to change Steps to 50 and CFG Scale to 1.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img36.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img36.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

4. In the prompt section, copy and paste one of the following prompts and then press the Generate button to start the image generation process.

   ```text
   A realistic landscape painting of a cabin in the mountains, wet on wet oil painting, landscape, mountain lake, by Bob Ross.
   ```

   OR


   ```text
   Profile of sad Socrates, full body, high detail, dramatic scene, Epic dynamic action, wide angle, cinematic, hyper-realistic, concept art, warm muted tones as painted by Bernie Wrightson, Frank Frazetta.
   ```

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img37.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img37.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

5. During the first generation, the model will begin to load into VRAM. Once complete, the image generation will begin.

6. The image generation can be monitored on the right side of the screen. Subsequent image generations will be faster since we have already preloaded the model into memory.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img38.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img38.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

7. When the image generation completes, click on the image to open it in full resolution. Click on the image again to return.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img39.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img39.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

8. Feel free to experiment with different settings and be creative with your image descriptions to generate unique results.

9. To see the impact on GPU utilization while Stable Diffusion generates images, open a new Terminal session. Right-click on the Terminal and select New Window. Enter the following command to monitor GPU activity:

   ```bash
   nvtop
   ```

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img40.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img40.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

10. To increase the workload and generate multiple images, under Core Parameters set the Images option to 2. This will instruct the utility to create 2 images sequentially.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img41.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img41.png){:class="img-300"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

11. Before pressing the Generate button again, arrange your windows so you can see both SwarmUI and the GPU utilization data in the Terminal simultaneously. This setup will help you observe the GPU's performance in real-time as images are being generated.

12. Press the Generate button again to execute the generation process with your new settings.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img42.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img42.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

13. SwarmUI places significant demands on the GPU, leveraging its parallel processing capabilities to perform the complex calculations required for image generation. Monitoring GPU performance is crucial for understanding how efficiently the model runs and for identifying potential bottlenecks. By keeping an eye on GPU utilization, memory usage, temperature, and power consumption, you can ensure that your system is running optimally and take steps to manage and mitigate any issues that arise.

&nbsp;

This concludes Task 2. Please proceed to the next task.

&nbsp;

[↑ Back to Top](#)
### Task 3: (*Optional*) Using SwarmUI for text-to-image generation (without GPU)

 We can really showcase the benefit of adding a GPU to help accelerate your AI Workload by rerunning the above steps but only leveraging this Systems CPU resources. No GPU!

1. Go back to the Server tab and then click on the Backends tab.

2. Click the Pencil icon and edit the ExtraArgs field to only have the following:

   ```bash
   --cpu
   ```

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img43.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img43.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

3. Click Save and wait for the backend to restart.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img44.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img44.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

4. Now, go back to the Generate tab. Have a try at re-running some of your previous prompts to see how much longer they take to Generate an image. How long did it take? Yep, you guessed it! Over 45mins for a single image on CPU only.
Feel free to click the Red X next to the generate button when you get tired of waiting as this is the last step in the section.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img45.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img45.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img46.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img46.png){:class="img-200"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

## Section 3: Create your own RAG enabled AI Assistant

Natural Language Processing AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Modifying responses with your own information.

Develop and deploy end-to-end AI to power natural language processing for:

- Agentic AI

- Text-to-Speech Generation

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation

To drive enterprise implementations of natural language processing such as speech AI, HPE designed the ultra-scalable HPE ProLiant DL380a Gen12 server. Together with NVIDIA H200 NVL GPUs and the full suite of NVIDIA AI Enterprise tools, this is a great AI platform for running large language models used by the financial services and manufacturing sectors as well as customer service across a range of industries.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. They are however a snapshot in time.

RAG extends LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output, so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.

In this lab, we will install and use Open WebUI. Open WebUI is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted AI platform designed to operate entirely offline. It supports various LLM runners like Ollama, vLLM and OpenAI-compatible APIs, with built-in inference engine for RAG, making it a powerful AI deployment solution.

### Task 1: Installing Open WebUI

Our first set of tasks is to download and install Open WebUI bundled with Ollama for Docker. This installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. To get started, follow the steps below.

1. From a new Terminal session, copy and paste the following docker run command to start the Open WebUI installation script.

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
   ```
   This docker run command sets up a highly available, GPU-accelerated container for the open-webui application, configured to use the host's network and persist data via a mounted volume.

2. If asked, type your lab password and press Enter.

3. After a few minutes, the installation will complete. There are two additional steps to enable the environment for use. Return to your Lab station’s Ubuntu desktop to complete the first time setup.

4. In the Chromium browser, navigate to the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:3000/

5. Click on the Get Started button at the bottom of the page.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img48.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img48.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

6. On first startup, you are required to create an Admin account. Use the info below to create the Admin account.

   Name:
   ```text
   Admin
   ```
   Email:
   ```text

    > Ollama models like gemma3:4b are advanced AI large language models designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are typically based on state-of-the-art architectures such as transformers and are trained on vast amounts of diverse text data. These models can perform various natural language processing tasks including text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, and more. They are often deployed via APIs, allowing easy integration into different applications and services. Ollama models aim to provide scalable, customizable, and high-performance solutions for a wide range of industries and use cases.
    The "4B" in "gemma3:4b" denotes that the model has 4 billion parameters. Parameters are the components of a model that are learned from the training data, and having more parameters typically means the model has greater capacity to learn and represent complex patterns in the data.

### Task 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Modifying responses with your own information

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. They are however a snapshot in time.

RAG extends LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output, so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.

Open WebUI allows you to upload your own documents into a knowledge base that the LLM can then access. This is useful for summarizations, data visualization, and RAG. That knowledge base can then be accessed by all the users or restricted to a certain group of users.

In the following steps of this lab, you will deploy an AI Assistant with RAG capabilities.

1. First we need to set the way Open WebUI will chunck the data we give it. With RAG, chunking is the process of splitting large documents into smaller, meaningful segments (chunks) so they can be efficiently indexed, retrieved, and used as context for a LLM. Click on the User Icon in the lower left corner of the browser. Then click on Admin Panel.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img60.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/AI-Inferencing/img60.png){:class="img-600"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

## Summary

For this HOL you experienced three main AI technology areas all running locally on HPE ProLiant Compute.

You experienced Vision AI using a solution called Vaidio running on the HPE DL320 Gen11. For text-to-image generation we ran SwarmUI. For natural language processing we used Open WebUI to create a RAG enabled AI assistant.

The servers used for the last two exercises were 2x ProLiant DL380 Gen12 with 2x NVIDIA L40s GPUs each.

&nbsp;

This concludes the hands-on lab experience.
