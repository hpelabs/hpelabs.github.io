Here is an overview of our Compute management portfolio.

- HPE Compute Ops Management delivers unified operations as-a-service
  from edge to cloud. In this HOL you will work with this technology.

- HPE iLO7 is embedded server management that enables you to securely
  configure, monitor, and update your HPE servers from anywhere. Again,
  in this HOL you will work with this technology too.

- HPE OneView is integrated IT infrastructure management software that
  automates IT operations and simplifies infrastructure lifecycle
  management across compute, storage, and networking. It is an onsite
  management strategy and is not the focus of this workshop.

This HOL takes a technical approach to how these tools can be used to
manage HPE ProLiant Servers with a strong focus around Security.

# Embedded Server Management with HPE iLO7

HPE Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) is an embedded server management
technology from HPE that provides out-of-band management capabilities.
Key features of HPE iLO7 include a virtual KVM console, virtual media,
power management, console record-and-replay, and comprehensive remote
console functionality. It enables administrators to manage servers
remotely, regardless of the state of the operating system or the
condition of the server itself, if power is available to the system.
This remote management is facilitated through a dedicated HPE iLO7 port
on the server, but you can connect via the HPE iLO7’s ethernet port as
well.

This portion of the lab assumes the server has power, HPE iLO7’s
ethernet port is connected to a management network switch and the
default password information has been gathered from the toe-tag on the
front of the server.

[![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image7.jpeg){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:4.28478in;height:2.51527in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image7.jpeg){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

In this lab environment, a DHCP server assigns IP addresses to known
hosts using DHCP reservations. This ensures that the lab unit you access
receives the same IP address each time it boots after the lab is reset.
Refer to the table below for your team’s name and number, as well as the
default Administrator credentials for the HPE iLO7 you will be using. Be
sure to also record your server’s serial number.

# Managing Local Users

> One of the initial tasks for administrators when deploying systems in
> their environment is to ensure compliance with established corporate
> standards. This typically includes provisioning local user accounts
> within HPE iLO7 and configuring HPE iLO7 network settings, such as
> assigning static IP addresses. Administrators may also need to modify
> additional HPE iLO7 parameters that ship with factory‑default values
> to align the baseboard management controller with organizational
> security and operational requirements.

# Firmware Verification

The Firmware Verification feature allows you to run an on-demand scan or
implement scheduled scans. To respond to detected issues, you can
configure HPE iLO7 to:

- Log the results.

- Log the results and initiate a repair action that uses a recovery
  install set.

Depending on the scan results, information is logged in the Active
Health System Log and the Integrated Management Log. The following
firmware types are supported:

- HPE iLO7 Firmware

- System ROM (BIOS)

- System Programmable Logic Device (CPLD)

When a firmware verification scan is in progress, HPE recommends not
installing firmware updates or uploading firmware to the iLO Repository
during this process. If an invalid iLO or System ROM (BIOS) firmware
file is detected, the invalid file is saved to a quarantine card in the
HPE iLO7’s Repository. You can download the invalid file to investigate
its type and origin. Quarantined images are not displayed on the iLO
Repository page, and you cannot select them when you use the Flash
Firmware feature.

1.  Click on the **Firmware** link to explore the HPE iLO7 capability to
    manually scan the system firmware and to check the validity and
    health of the firmware components.

2.  Click on the **Firmware Verification** card.

4.  Click **Settings** and **Enable Background Scan** with an Integrity
    Failure Action of **Log Only**. The default setting is 7 days, but
    for this lab, change the **Scan Interval** to **1**.

5.  Click **Update** to save the scan settings. You should see that the
    scan settings have been saved successfully.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image22.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:2.88801in;height:3.23008in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image22.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

6.  Click **Run Scan** to trigger a runtime firmware verification of the
    component firmware, to ensure validity. This scan is performed by
    the HPE iLO7 processor and does not consume clock cycles from the
    server’s CPUs. This action can be called from the API or a language
    binding like HPE iLO7 REST Utility or PowerShell.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image23.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.97767in;height:3.59901in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image23.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

# Connecting to HPE Compute Ops Management

The HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform enables IT administrators to connect
and manage devices and cloud services under a unified service presented
by HPE. HPE compute, storage, and networking devices may be centrally
managed whether on premises, at the edge, co-located, or on the other
side of the world.

This single HPE GreenLake dashboard allows administrators to launch
domain specific applications like Compute Ops Management, Aruba Central,
Data Services, along with tools to manage governance like OpsRamp and
gain insights in the HPE Sustainability Insight Center.

# Secure Login Options for Enterprise IT Administrators

In the previous section of this lab, we were able to login to our HPE
Compute Ops Management Workspace with an email address and somewhat
complex password. In today’s world, this is no longer secure enough to
meet Industry Security Standards and additional safeguards should be
configured.

Our HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform supports Multi-Factor Authentication as
well as SAML SSO which combining both together, can go a long way to
ensuring any bad actors do not access your IT Estate, especially through
HPE Compute Ops Management.

For this Lab, we will just walk you through the various locations in HPE
GreenLake Cloud Platform where this can be configured, but we will not
actually set it up at this time.

1.  From the **Quick Links** on the right-hand side of the GreenLake
    Home Page, click **Manage Workspace**.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image29.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:4.32908in;height:1.88406in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image29.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

2.  Select the **Workspace Details** card**.**

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image30.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.44443in;height:2.88011in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image30.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

3.  In the Actions pull down, navigate to the **Manage MFA** list.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image31.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.50156in;height:2.53514in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image31.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

4.  This is where Multifactor Authentication can be configured for all
    Users within the Workspace. Currently supported methods are Okta
    Verify, Security Key or Biometric Authenticator and Google
    Authenticator.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image32.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:2.5309in;height:4.15285in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image32.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}
>
> **Note: For the purpose of this lab, we will NOT be configuring MFA on
> these Workspaces.**

When enabling Multifactor Authentication (MFA), you significantly
enhance the security of your account when signing in to HPE GreenLake.
By requiring multiple forms of verification, such as a password and a
one-time code sent to your mobile device, MFA adds an extra layer of
protection against unauthorized access. This reduces the risk of account
compromise, even if your password is stolen or guessed. Implementing MFA
is a crucial step in safeguarding your sensitive data and ensuring
secure access to HPE GreenLake services.

**Note**: MFA can also be configured at the user level from the **HPE
user account details**. However, please do **NOT** enable it for this
lab.\

# Establishing a connection from HPE iLO7 to HPE GreenLake

For our lab purposes, the HPE GreenLake Workspace company in this
environment is called *COM Security Lab XX*.

The connection between HPE iLO7 and HPE GreenLake is initiated by the
HPE iLO7 for security purposes. During the onboarding process, an
HPE-issued client certificate is used by the HPE iLO7 to connect to HPE
Compute Ops Management. The HPE CA Certificate uses SHA256 with a key
size of EC 384 bits and is transmitted over a Mutual Transport Layer
Security (mTLS) connection from the HPE iLO7 to HPE GreenLake and
Compute Ops Management over HTTPS (port 443). In a typical TLS setup,
only the server is authenticated by the client. In mTLS, both the client
and the server authenticate each other, providing enhanced security by
ensuring that both parties are authenticated before establishing a
secure communication channel.

For more information regarding the security protocols and firewall
requirements, consult the [HPE Compute Ops Management security
guide](https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/a50004539enw).

To initiate the connection from HPE iLO7 to the HPE Compute Ops

# Securing your Server Fleet with HPE Compute Ops Management

HPE Compute Ops Management provides the core platform for delivering HPE
compute services, enabling a standardized, self‑service, and real‑time
operational model for IT administrators across the datacenter and
edge‑to‑cloud infrastructures. It delivers a unified control plane that
consolidates compute management into a single cloud‑hosted interface,
reducing operational overhead and ensuring continuous access to newly
released features, service enhancements, and security updates.

In this portion of the lab, we will focus on configuring Server Groups
and applying Server Settings. This is the security configuration and
lifecycle management aspect of your assigned server. We will create
settings for the systems and place those settings into Groups. This
ensures consistency across all servers assigned to those groups.

Return to your HOL Horizon Browser session.

1.  From the HPE Compute Ops Management main menu. Select the **Manage**
    option.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image46.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.575in;height:2.95577in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image46.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

# Advanced Security settings for HPE iLO7

HPE iLO (Integrated Lights-Out) provides robust security features to
mitigate risks in networked environments. Features like Trusted Platform
Module (TPM) or TM Status, Local User Account Controls and Directory
Group Account Controls that support Kerberos authentication or
schema-free directory integration. You can set server name and FQDN/IP
addresses yourself but consider leaving those values blank to let the
host OS assign them. There are Secure Shell (SSH) Key Settings that can
be managed for secure communication with the HPE iLO7 management
processor itself.

In this lab we will look at security parameters like in Network Settings
where we can enable/disable various services (e.g., SSH, SNMP, Virtual
Media.) We will configure <u>anonymous data</u> and IPMI/DCMI over LAN.
Idle Connection Timeout values can be set.

While security is crucial, striking a balance between protection and
usability is essential. Implement settings based on your organization’s
needs.

Finally, the HPE iLO7 Security Dashboard provides real-time insights to
monitor and manage security settings proactively.

1.  Navigate back to your assigned Servers **HPE iLO 7**.

2.  From the **HPE iLO7 Dashboard** page, click on **Security** link.

# HPE iLO7 SSL Certificate Management

By default, HPE iLO7 uses a self-signed certificate in SSL connections.
While this allows for encrypted communication, it lacks the trust and
verification provided by a Certificate Authority (CA). A CA-signed
certificate is issued by a trusted third-party CA, which verifies the
identity of the server (i.e. the HPE iLO7). This ensures that the
communication is with a legitimate HPE iLO7 device, significantly
reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where an attacker
could intercept and alter the communication.

Using a CA-signed certificate on HPE iLO7 provides several benefits:

- **Trust and Verification**: Ensures that both the client and server
  can verify each other's identity through a trusted CA.

- **Enhanced Security**: Prevents unauthorized entities from
  intercepting and misusing sensitive credentials.

- **Avoiding Security Warnings**: Browsers and other clients trust
  CA-signed certificates, avoiding confusing security warnings.

To enhance overall security and trust, it is recommended to configure
HPE iLO7 with a CA-signed certificate. An easy way to achieve this is by
using HPE iLO7’s support for obtaining and renewing SSL certificates
automatically via ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment).

This method offers several key benefits over the manual method of using
a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and requesting a certificate from a
Certificate Authority (CA). It significantly reduces administrative
overhead by automating the process of certificate issuance and renewal,
ensuring that certificates are always up to date without manual
intervention. This automation minimizes the risk of service disruptions
due to expired certificates and enhances security by regularly
refreshing cryptographic keys. Additionally, it provides a scalable
solution for managing certificates across many devices, ensuring
consistent and compliant security practices throughout the organization.

To learn more about ACME, see [How It Works - Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/).

By default, this feature is disabled in HPE iLO7. In this section, we
are going to enable it and configure automatic certificate enrollment in
HPE iLO7 to obtain a trusted SSL certificate signed by a CA.

If you are looking for information about how to do it manually, see
[Generate CSR and Import an SSL
Certificate](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=sd00002007en_us&page=GUID-D7147C7F-2016-0901-06D0-000000000CC0.html).

1.  The first step is to download the root CA certificate of the
    certificate enrollment server to secure the connection between the
    HPE iLO7 and the ACME server. This server is our internal lab
    Certificate Authority (CA) server, running on Ubuntu with step-ca.\
    We’ve saved you from the trouble and provided the root CA contents
    here.

2.  We can now navigate to our **Security** page in HPE iLO7.

3.  Click on the **TLS Certificate** card.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image102.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.49778in;height:3.39689in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image102.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

4.  We will now select **Configure Certificate**.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image103.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.4973in;height:3.2009in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image103.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

5.  Fill in our details for **Manage TLS Certificate Automatically**.

6.  Our **Server URL** is
    <https://holacme01.hol.enablement.local:443/acme/acme/directory> ,
    you will also need to paste in the CA Certificate we shared in
    Step 1. For other values in the form, see table below. Then click
    **Configure**.

      | **Server URL:** | See text in step 6 |
      |---|---|
      | **Country (C)** | US |
      | **State (ST)** | TX |
      | **City or Locality (L)** | Houston |
      | **Organization Name (O)** | HPE |

7.  You should see that the status of the certificate operation is “**In
    progress**” and this takes a minute or so.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image105.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:5.65804in;height:2.57179in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image105.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

8.  Soon the status will be **Success**.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image106.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:5.67227in;height:2.71466in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image106.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

9.  Note, an **iLO Reset Pending** icon has appeared and will need to be
    clicked to properly activate the Certificate. Click **Yes, reset**.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image107.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:2.16685in;height:1.43346in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image107.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

10. Give the HPE iLO7 a **few minutes to reset**, then **open a new tab
    or browser** to login and confirm that the **connection** is now
    recognized as **secure** by the browser.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image108.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:5.37528in;height:2.11122in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image108.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

> added to the trusted root certificates of all client machines that
> connect to the HPE iLO7. In our lab environment, this process is
> automatically handled by our lab domain policy.

11. If you get a **Failed** status, you can check the HPE iLO7 Security
    logs under **Dashboard** / **Security Log**. This is where ACME
    activity is generated.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image109.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.97901in;height:3.61046in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image109.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

12. If you face an enrollment failure, it is recommended to double check
    all values under the TLS Certificate Server configuration and then
    perform an update. Only do this if you have an issue. If you take
    this action what follows will result.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image110.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.50555in;height:2.55558in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image110.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

13. Referring to the Security Log, a message that the HPE iLO7 must be
    reset to use the new certificate is displayed.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image111.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.9526in;height:2.1148in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image111.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

14. Go to **iLO Settings** and click **Rest iLO** in the **Quick
    Actions** card.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image112.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.94485in;height:2.7521in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image112.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

15. A successful Certificate Enrollment, will show that now the **HPE
    iLO7** uses a **trusted SSL certificate signed** by our
    **certificate authority server**:

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image113.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:6.8391in;height:2.43588in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image113.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

16. You can now circle back to **HPE Compute Ops Management** and check
    the **iLO Security Status**.

      [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image114.png){: .bordered-image-thin style="width:3.90631in;height:4.42977in"}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/Proliant-Security/image114.png){: data-lightbox="gallery"}

(VMware ESXi 7/8), it addresses critical challenges in firewall
management, traffic efficiency, and operational control:

**Key Benefits:**

- **Simplified Firewall Management**: Establishes a single secure
  outbound connection to HPE Compute Ops Management, dramatically
  reducing firewall complexity, minimizing exposed ports, and shrinking
  the attack surface.

- **Efficient Traffic Aggregation**: Consolidates multiple HPE iLO
  WebSocket connections into one unified egress stream, streamlining
  operations and reducing vulnerability risks from fragmented
  connections.

- **Optimized Bandwidth Usage**: Caches firmware components locally when
  HPE iLOs are updated, eliminating redundant downloads for subsequent
  server updates, improving update reliability, and conserving
  bandwidth.

- **Instant Connection Control**: Enables immediate disconnection of all
  HPE iLO-to-COM connections when needed, providing agile response
  capabilities for compliance requirements, troubleshooting, or security
  incidents.

# Summary

In this lab, we explored the robust capabilities of HPE's integrated
Lights-Out (HPE iLO7) management tools, specifically HPE iLO7, within
the ProLiant Gen12 series. We also examined how HPE Compute Ops
Management offers secure and efficient remote management of HPE servers,
enabling administrators to access and control systems from virtually
anywhere—provided the necessary security configurations are in place.

By implementing HPE iLO7 security best practices—such as secure network
access, strong authentication methods, and encryption—users can maintain
a secure environment while remotely managing ProLiant servers. This
applies across various environments, from remote offices and edge
systems to large datacenters. HPE’s unified management strategy ensures
consistency in system oversight, regardless of location.

Additionally, we demonstrated how HPE Compute Ops Management integrates
seamlessly with a Secure Gateway, highlighting the ease and security of
remote management. With HPE ProLiant Compute, HPE empowers IT
administrators with both the flexibility and security needed to maintain
full control of their hardware, no matter where it’s located.
