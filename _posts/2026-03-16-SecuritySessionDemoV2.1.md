# HPE ProLiant Security Demo – Purpose

## The Purpose

The purpose of this demonstration is to show how to configure an HPE ProLiant Gen12 server with SED‑enabled storage devices and SED‑enabled hard‑drive controllers, and how to connect each of them to an External Key Manager.

During the demonstration, you will connect to the Thales Cypher Trust Manager server and observe a user being created as part of the iLO joining the key manager. You will then see keys being issued as we successfully request a key to enable encryption on the devices.

A challenge in the demonstration environment is that, when you log in to use the equipment, you may find the system in one of two states. The system may already have encryption enabled and be connected to the External Key Manager, or—preferably—you may start with the server not connected to the External Key Manager and none of the devices have encryption enabled.

To illustrate these two states, please review the screen captures of the relevant sections in iLO 7 below.

## Get Connected

You will connect to a Omnissa Horizon environment. With your browser (Chrome recommended) connect to the following URLs based on your present location:

- Outside of an HPE office use: [https://16.103.2.134/](https://16.103.2.134/)

- Inside an HPE office use: [https://10.182.0.33/](https://10.182.0.33/)

With:
- Username: RSA_Security
- Password: `<email Chris.Powell@hpe.com>`

### Procedure:

1. After clicking one of the links above, you will be presented with the "Your connection isn’t private" prompt, click on **Advanced**.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG001.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG001.png){:class="img-800"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

2. Click on the link to Continue to your IP address. This is not an "unsafe" thing to do in this case.

## Preferred Starting State

In different sections within iLO7, you can see the various states of "encryption" for the devices installed in the computer. In each of the areas below, we are highlighting each storage controllers starting configuration before encryption capability has been enabled.

You can see each of the controllers in the iLO7 from the Dashboard in the left navigation tree.

1. Select **Host**.
2. Now select the **Hardware** card to see the various devices in the system. Please be aware that the server needs to boot, even if that is just to the System Configuration utility, before it will give you a list of all the devices in the computer. This need to be rebooted coupled with the configuration changes we are going to make to the devices, which means rebooting the system must occur before any changes take effect. If you don’t see what you expect, it is most likely that the system needs to be rebooted.
3. Click on the **Storage** card.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG003.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG003.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

4. The screenshot below is the NS204i-u controller. Again, you got here by going to **Host** -> **Hardware** -> **Storage** -> **Storage Controllers** to see this. Click on **View More** under the controller to see that the encryption mode is `Disabled`. This is expected because the NS204i-u does not provide any encryption capability at the controller level. In this case Encryption is handled at the storage device level, the 960GB storage devices themselves.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG004.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG004.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

5. To see the status of the 960GB storage devices, move down in the screen and click on the logical volume information in the **Volumes** card. Note that Encrypted is `False` in volume information, and for each 960GB device the Encryption Status is `Unencrypted`.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG005.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG005.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

6. Now let’s look at the MR416i-p harddrive controller. Again, we return to **Host** -> **Hardware** -> **Storage** -> **Storage Controllers** and we then click on the MR416i-p information.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG006.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG006.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

7. Click on **View More** to see the encryption area. Note that Encryption Mode is `UseLocalKey`.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG007.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG007.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

8. You can also look at the individual storage devices to see their encryption status. From **Host** -> **Hardware** -> **Storage** -> **Storage Drives**.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG008.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG008.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

9. The next Solution to look at is the External Key Manager that we will use for our demonstration. We are using a Thales Trust Manager system running in our lab.

This Ends this Section.

2. Click on **Access Management**.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG010.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG010.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

3. Click on **Users** – Show that only two users currently exist. We previously created the user called "iLO7-user".

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG011.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG011.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

4. Click on **Keys** – This key was created prior to the demonstration and is named "iLO7-key-master".

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG013.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG013.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

5. Click on the key itself to reveal the `ID` Field. This is what is needed by the iLO7 to connect to Thales.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG014.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG014.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

6. Copy the `ID` Field into the clipboard.
7. Optional – In **Access Management**, click on **Groups** and explain that the iLO7-user is in the group. You must search for "iLO" to find the group.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG015.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG015.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

# Configure the SED Devices to Unlock Encryption via Postman

We will now configure the SED storage devices.

1. Return to the demonstration environment.

2. Open the **Postman** utility in your System Tray.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG032.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG032.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

3. In the **My Workspace** area, locate the **Z-Disk_Encryption** section. These are the numbered scripts that will be used to change the SED status of our Storage devices connected to our NS204i-u boot controller.

4. Click on **1-Get Storage Status** to get the status of the storage devices in question.

5. By clicking on the step, you load the script and are ready to then click **Send** to send the command to the devices.

6. After the command is received, the status of the command is returned. You are looking for `200 OK` in the results area.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG033.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG033.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

7. We will now take the second step, **2-Local- PATCH Encryption Mode UseLocalKey**. Click on the script to make it active and then click **Send**. This changes the encryption to use a local key. You must reboot for changes to take effect.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG035.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG035.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

8. Our next step, **3-SetEncryptionKey**, sets the keys to be used. Select the step and again click **Send** to commit the changes. Look for `200 OK` to know the steps worked.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG036.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG036.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

9. Now return to the iLO7 in the Gen12 system and reboot to the **System Configuration utility**.

10. Take a tour of the ILO to show that Encryption is now enabled. First, note that the Storage controller is now set to `UseLocalKey`.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG037.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG037.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

11. Click on the controller and then when you "View More" of the information for the NS204i-u, the Logical Volume has the **Encrypted** value set to `True`.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG038.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG038.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

12. When you drill down on the logical volume, you see that for each device the **Encryption** Status is `Unlocked`.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG039.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG039.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

- At this point you have completed the demonstration.

# Resetting the security demonstration environment

Hopefully throughout this document we stressed the "before" and "after" nature needed to effectively show this demonstration.

The way you delete the iLO7 from the Thales server is basically the reverse of the steps you took to add the Thales server to iLO7. Go to **Security** -> **Remote Key Manager** and then remove the entries we had you add.

1. From the **Dashboard** go to **Security**.

2. Go to **Remote Key Manager** card

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG016.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG016.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

3. Edit the **Servers** card and remove the IP address and the Port information.

4. Edit the **Configuration** card. Remove the information about the Thales solution.

5. For the MR416i-p harddrive controller, you return to the **System Configuration** -> Click on the Controller -> **Main Menu** -> **Controller Management** -> **Advanced Controller Management** and then disable drive security. Basically, reversing the steps you took to enable security.

6. Finally, for the 960GB SED devices connected to the NS204i-u controller, from your **Postman** console, run the final command **z-Storage.ResetTo.Defaults**, make sure you click **Send**. This time you should get a `202 Accepted` message.

    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG040.png){: .bordered-image-thin}]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/SecuritySessionDemo/IMG040.png){:class="img-900"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

- In all these cases, changes are not made until you reboot the server.
